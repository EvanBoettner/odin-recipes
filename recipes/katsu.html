        favorite.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1-1/2 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>2 boneless pork loin chops (1/2-inch thick)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour)</li>
        <li>1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)</li>
        <li>
          1/2 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)
          (for the egg)
        </li>
        <li>1 leaf green cabbage</li>
        <li>4 slices shokupan (Japanese milk bread)</li>
        <li>2 tsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large frying pan, add 1 cup panko and 1-1/2 Tbsp of oil and turn
          the heat to medium to medium-high
        </li>
        <li>
          Lift the pan and shake it once in a while to evenly toast the panko.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the panko is getting darker, keep shaking the pan to get even
          color. Once the panko is nicely brown, transfer to the tray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to
          400 degrees F. For a convention oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25
          degerees F.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the extra fat and make a couple of slits on the connective
          tissue between the meat and fat. The reason why you do this is that
          red meat and fat have different elasticity, and when they are cooked
          they will shrink and expand at different rates. This will allow
          Tonkatsu to stay nice and flat when deep frying and prevent it from
          curling up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pound the meat with a meat pounder. If you don't have one, just use
          the back of a Knife to pound. When using a knife, crisscross by first
          pounding top to bottom then left to right.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mold the extended meat back into original shape with your hands.
          Season the meat with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the flour in a shallow dish. Whisk together the egg and oil in
          another shallow dish or bowl. Line up these two dishes along with the
          dish of toasted panko to prepare for breading the pork.
        </li>
        <li>Dredge in flour and remove excess flour.</li>
        <li>Dip in egg mixture. Dredge in panko.</li>
        <li>
          Press panko onto the meat and transfer to the baking sheet lined with
          parchment paper or even better if you have an oven-safe wire rack (as
          air goes through on the bottom so panko doesn't get crushed).
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake at 400 degrees F until the pork is cooked through, about 20
          minutes. Remove the tonkatsu from the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Thinly shred the cabbage leaf.</li>
        <li>
          Spread the butter on both bread slices (butter would act as a
          waterproof guard so sandwich doesn't get soggy). Spread Dijon mustard
          on top of butter one side.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the katsu sauce on the other side.</li>
        <li>
          Put the thinly shredded cabbage evenly on the dijon mustard side. Then
          drizzle katsu sauce over the cabbage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the tonkatsu on top of the cabbage and top with the other bread.
          Place the sandwich between two plates for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Cut off the crusts of the bread and cut in half.</li>
      </ol>
