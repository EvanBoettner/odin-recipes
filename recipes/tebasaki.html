      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike the other Japanese fried chicken, Tebasaki is always made with
        bone-in chicken wings, has no breading, and is seasoned after it's
        fried. Despite the absence of any significant crust, the wings end up
        rice cracker crisp thanks to a double-dip into the fryer. Think of these
        as the Japanese cousin of Buffalo wings, and Korean fried chicken.
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>800 grams of chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of evaporated cane sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of sake</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ginger juice</li>
        <li>4 grams of grated garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of black vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of potato starch</li>
        <li>vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of toasted sesame seeds</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Put the chicken wings in a single layer on a tray and sprinkle with
          half of the salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toss the chicken to coat evenly refrigerate while you prepare the
          other ingredients
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the glaze by putting the sugar, soy sauce, sake, ginger juice,
          and garlic in a shallow pan. Heat over medium-high heat until the
          glaze starts to thicken. You can tell when it's ready when the bubbles
          get big and shiny.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the vinegar, and then transfer to a large bowl and allow the glaze
          to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add about 2-inches of vegetable oil to a heavy-bottomed pot and heat
          to 320 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the chicken out of the fridge and use paper towels to remove as
          much moisture from the surface of the chicken as possible. Sprinkle on
          the potato starch and toss the wings to evenly coat each piece witha
          thin layer of starch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry the chicken wings for 10 minutes in batches. Transfer to a plate
          and continue frying the rest of the wings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increase the heat of the oil to 375 degrees F. Fry the chicken in
          smaller batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. The chicken
          is done when the wings are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the wings directly to the bowl of glaze and quickly toss to
          coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle on some toasted sesame seeds and black pepper to taste and
          toss again. Don't let the wings sit in the glaze for too long.
        </li>
