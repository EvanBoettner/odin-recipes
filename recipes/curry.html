      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p class="description">
        Curry rice, or kare rice (pronounced karē raisu), is a dish that was
        brought to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912) from the British, when
        India was under colonial rule. It was served to the Japanese Imperial
        Navy to prevent thiamine (vitamin B-1) deficiency and became popular
        across Japan in the 1960s when curry made its appearance in restaurants
        and supermarkets.
